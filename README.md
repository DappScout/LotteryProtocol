# [Plan] 🎯 Advanced Random Airdrop System with Chainlink VRF & Automation

A comprehensive Solidity project that combines **Chainlink VRF** (Verifiable Random Function) and **Chainlink Automation** to create a fully automated, fair, and transparent airdrop distribution system.

## 🌟 What Makes This Project Special

This isn't just another airdrop contract. It's a **complete automated ecosystem** that demonstrates advanced smart contract patterns, Chainlink integrations, and real-world deployment strategies.

### Key Innovations:
- **Fully Automated**: No manual intervention required after setup
- **Provably Fair**: Uses Chainlink VRF for verifiable randomness
- **Time-Based Phases**: Automatic transitions between registration, selection, and distribution
- **Multi-Tier Rewards**: Different prize tiers (Grand Prize, Runner-ups, Participation rewards)
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient batch operations for large participant pools
- **Security Hardened**: Anti-Sybil protection and comprehensive testing

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By building this project, you'll master:

### 🔗 Chainlink VRF Integration
- Requesting and handling verifiable random numbers
- Managing VRF subscriptions and LINK payments
- Implementing callback functions with proper error handling
- Working with request IDs and async responses

### 🤖 Chainlink Automation (Keepers)
- Setting up automated time-based triggers
- Implementing `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` functions
- Managing contract state transitions automatically
- Handling complex automation logic

### 🏗️ Advanced Smart Contract Patterns
- **Custom Errors**: Gas-efficient error handling
- **Events**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Enums**: Clean state management
- **Modifiers**: Access control and validation
- **CEI Pattern**: Checks-Effects-Interactions security

### 🧪 Professional Testing & Deployment
- Unit tests with Foundry
- Integration tests with forked networks
- Fuzz testing for edge cases
- Mock contracts for local development
- Deployment scripts for multiple networks
- Gas optimization techniques

## 🚀 How The System Works

### Phase 1: Registration Period (Automated)
```solidity
// Users register during open period
function registerForAirdrop() external {
    // Anti-Sybil checks
    // Eligibility verification
    // Add to participants array
}
```

### Phase 2: Automated Selection (Chainlink Automation)
```solidity
// Chainlink Automation triggers this when time is up
function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata) external view returns (bool, bytes memory) {
    bool timeHasPassed = (block.timestamp - lastTimeStamp) > interval;
    bool hasPlayers = participants.length > 0;
    // Return true when ready to select winners
}
```

### Phase 3: Random Winner Selection (Chainlink VRF)
```solidity
// Automatically called by Chainlink Automation
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata) external {
    // Request random numbers from VRF
    // Select multiple winners for different tiers
}
```

### Phase 4: Automated Distribution
```solidity
// Winners can claim their rewards
function claimAirdrop() external {
    // Verify winner status
    // Transfer tokens
    // Update state
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
forge test --match-test testRegistration
forge test --match-test testVRFCallback
forge test --match-test testAutomation
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Fuzz Tests
```bash
forge test --match-test testFuzz_MultipleRegistrations
```

### Gas Analysis
```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

## 🚀 Deployment & Interaction

### Local Development
```bash
# Start local blockchain
anvil

# Deploy to local
forge script script/DeployAirdrop.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

### Testnet Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"

# Verify contract
make verify ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

### Interaction Scripts
```bash
# Register for airdrop
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "registerForAirdrop()" --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Check registration status
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "isRegistered(address)" $YOUR_ADDRESS
```

## 📊 Advanced Features

### Multi-Tier Prize System
- **Grand Prize**: 1 winner gets 50% of prize pool
- **Runner-ups**: 5 winners get 8% each
- **Participation**: All others get small reward

### Weighted Selection
- Base weight: 1 (everyone gets this)
- Token holder bonus: +1 per 1000 tokens
- Referral bonus: +1 per successful referral
- Early bird bonus: +1 for first 100 registrants

    uint32 timestamp;    // 4 bytes
    bool claimed;        // 1 byte
}
```
